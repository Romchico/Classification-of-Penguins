## Project Objective

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively predict the species of a penguin based on its physical characteristics. The model will be trained using a simplified version of the original penguin dataset, which contains information on three different species of penguins (Chinstrap, Adélie, and Gentoo) on three islands (Dream, Torgersen, and Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago, located in Antarctica.

## Variables
The simplified dataset, penguins_size.csv, contains the following variables:

    * species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Adélie, or Gentoo)
    * culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
    * culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
    * flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
    * body_mass_g: body mass (g)
    * island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica)
    * sex: penguin sex

## Project Outcome

By developing an accurate predictive model, we hope to provide researchers with a useful tool that can be used to classify penguins in the field without requiring the expertise of a highly experienced biologist.
